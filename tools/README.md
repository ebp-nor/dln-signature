Here we have gathered a bit more information about different tools that might be useful in the project. 

[gfastats](https://github.com/vgl-hub/gfastats) gives summary statistics of genome assemblies from different formats. For instance number of scaffolds and contigs, N50 scaffold and contig and so on.

[BUSCO](busco.md) often used to assess genome assembly and annotation completeness with Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO).

[Cactus](cactus.md), the multiple whole genome aligner. 

[OrthoFinder](OrthoFinder.md), phylogenetic orthology inference for comparative genomics.

[Phylogenetic analyses](Phylogenetic_analyses.md), some useful tools.

[Databases](Databases.md), a short overview of some databases that might be of use.
