[EnsemblFungi](https://fungi.ensembl.org/index.html) contains a lot of genome assemblies of fungi and their annotations. You have most likely downloaded a dataset from there.

[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a database containing a lot of different information. Maybe one of the most used features is [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) where you can search for nucleotide or amino acid sequences in all their databases.

[UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org) is a large database of curated proteins. Here you can find more information about particular proteins.
