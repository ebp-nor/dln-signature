# Phylogenetic Analyses

Once you have your species tree and your gene trees yuo want to use these to make biological inferences. There are many methods that analyse data in a phylogenetic setting. Also, there are many useful tools to help you plot and visualize your phylogenetic trees. Here are some tips and tricks on how to get started with phylogenetic analyses. 

## File formats
Trees come in many different file formats. Nexus files (file.nex, .nxs etc), newick files (.nwk) or tree files (.tre). There are many more. 

The trick is to find a program that can interpret your data. [Figtree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) is a free program that is easy to use. Dowload this to your desktop and use it to open up treefiles, for instance from Orthofinder. In my experience, Figtree will recognize a treefile even if the extension is just .txt. It can open most trees. 

## Plottting trees in R

There are many R packages that are really handy for visualizing and analysing trees.
