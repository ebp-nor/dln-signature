# Harnessing data from biodiversity genomics projects

This is the description for the project called "Harnessing data from biodiversity genomics projects" in the Digital Life Norway course [BT8121 - Transdisciplinary biotechnology](https://www.digitallifenorway.org/research-school/events/BT8121---transdisciplinary-biotechnology_2022.html). Here you will find relavant literature, introductions and guides to relevant tools and presentations given, in addition to the description of the project itself.

The overall aim of this project is to use comparative genomics tools on a set of species to find interesting patterns between those species and to discover specific attributes of specific species. The species selected here are within [Mucoromycota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucoromycota), a division within fungi. Many species of this division have been used to produce lipids, polyphosphates and carotenoids.
