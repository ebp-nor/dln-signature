# Earth BioGenome Project and related projects

[The Earth BioGenome Project 2020: Starting the clock](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115635118) 
This article describes the purposes, goals and challenges of the Earth BioGenome Project.

[Why sequence all eukaryotes?](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2115636118) 
Here the authors suggest what challenges within biology can be solved by having high quality, whole genome assemblies for large groups of species such as all the branches of the tree of life or whole ecosystems.


# Genome assembly and annotation

# Comparative genomics

[This review](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.51) gives a broad overview of the topic, focusing on vertebrates (this group includes humans, fish, birds, reptiles etc). 

[Example of whole genome alignment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2876-6) using mammal genomes from the Zoonomia project. 



# Genome evolution

# Mucoromycota fungi

## Evolution of Mucoromycota fungi

[Phylogeny of fungi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.074) This is currently the most updated phylogeny of fungi. 

## Experimental work on Mucoromycota

[Mucoromycota fungi as powerful cell factories for modern biorefinery](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-021-11720-1) In this mini-review the authors give an overview of biotechnology apllications of Mucoromycota fungi. 

[Calcium Affects Polyphosphate and Lipid Accumulation in Mucoromycota Fungi](https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/7/4/300) This experiment is a vital contribution to understanding how to optimize lipid and/or pigment production by manipulating calcium levels and phosphate (pH).
