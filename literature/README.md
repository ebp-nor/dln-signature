# Earth BioGenome Project and related projects

[The Earth BioGenome Project 2020: Starting the clock](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115635118) This article describes the purposes, goals and challenges of the Earth BioGenome Project.

[Why sequence all eukaryotes?](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2115636118) Here the authors suggest what challenges within biology can be solved by having high quality, whole genome assemblies for large groups of species such as all the branches of the tree of life or whole ecosystems.
